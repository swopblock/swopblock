Swopblock - 
===============================================================================

## Real-time, counter-party-secure, exchange-party-free crypto trading.

Swopblock offers proven security, universal access, and realtime crypto currency 
trading in an exchange protocol that solves the problems with the insecurities 
of centralized exchanges, the 'on platform' limitations of decentralized 
exchanges and the slow and unresponsive performance of meet-up or 
Atomic Swap trading.

Swopblock is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public
License version 2 (some parts of it are under different licenses,
compatible with the GPLv2). It was originally written
with the help of developers around the net.

Please read the file [INSTALL][] for installation instructions.

Swopblock online is accessible from <https://swopblock.org/>

See [Documentation/swopblocktutorial.txt][] to get started, then see
[Documentation/swopblockeveryday.txt][] for a useful minimum set of commands, and
`Documentation/swopblock-<commandname>.txt` for documentation of each command.

The user discussion and development of Swopblock take place on the Swopblock
mailing list -- everyone is welcome to post bug reports, feature
requests, comments and patches to TBD (read
[Documentation/SubmittingPatches][] for instructions on patch submission).
To subscribe to the list, send an email with just "subscribe swopblock" in
the body to TBD. The mailing list archives are
available at TBD.

Issues which are security relevant should be disclosed privately to
the Swopblock Security mailing list TBD.

Reports will be sent periodically that
list the current status of various development topics to the mailing
list.  The discussion following them give a good reference for
project status, development direction and remaining tasks.
