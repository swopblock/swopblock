Purpose
=========

Swopblock LLC holds rights in the Marks on behalf of the Swopblock Project and has adopted this Policy to protect the Marks (as defined below) and to make sure that the identity of Swopblock software and its free and open source nature is clear to everyone. By using this Policy, the Swopblock Project can spread the use of the Swopblock software while making sure that the Marks are protected in a way that's consistent with U.S. trademark law (U.S. Registration Pending). This Policy is written to allow all clear and appropriate use of the Marks while disapproving use of the Marks in ways that could confuse users as to where the software came from, or that implies an otherwise non-existent association with the Swopblock Project. By adhering to this Policy, you help to promote to the public the freedom to use and develop the Swopblock software.

Throughout this Policy, the word "Marks" refers to the following:

The literal mark "Swopblock"

The logos and graphic marks displayed at https://swopblock.org

This Policy is only concerned with the Marks associated with the Swopblock Project, and does not address any copyrights associated with the Swopblock software.

Guidelines for using the Marks
==============================

Trademark symbol on first mention:

The first prominent mention of a Mark should be immediately followed by a symbol for, as applicable, a registered trademark (®) or an unregistered trademark (™). For example: "Swopblock™".

This requirement is waived in all contexts where such marks are not required to protect the intellectual property rights associated with the Marks, such as email, online discussion, and academic papers. We encourage the use of the applicable symbols whenever possible, but recognize that many users will omit them in non-commercial and informal contexts.

You can use "Swopblock and the Swopblock logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Swopblock LLC, home of the Swopblock Project, in the United States and/or other countries." when you need to mention "Swopblock" in e.g. list of trademarks held by other people.

Use of the Marks without written permission:

You may use the Marks without prior written permission (subject to the other sections):

To refer to the Swopblock software in substantially unmodified form. "Substantially unmodified" means built from the source code provided by the Swopblock Project, possibly with minor modifications including but not limited to: the enabling or disabling of certain features by default, translations into other languages, changes required for compatibility with a particular operating system distribution, or the inclusion of bug-fix patches.

To identify the Swopblock software as a distinct component of a software offering.

To factually refer to the Swopblock Project itself, its products, or its protocols.

In addition, you may use the Marks to refer to products, services, or communities outside of the Swopblock software and Swopblock Project without written permission in the following contexts:

When referring to Swopblock software that is not substantially unmodified, to say that such software is a "derivative of" or "based on" Swopblock.
When referring to a third-party software product and/or service that is interoperable with the Swopblock software, in the format "[Product Name] for Swopblock" -- provided that such use otherwise complies with the rest of this Policy.
We do not charge a fee for a license to use the Marks in these contexts. However, we do of course welcome donations. If you're interested in donating to the Swopblock Project, care of Swopblock LLC, visit https://github/swopblock and use the Sponsor button.

Prohibited usages of the Marks:

You may not use the Marks in the following ways:

In any way likely to cause confusion as to the identity of the Swopblock Project, the provenance of its software, or the software's license.

In any way that indicates a greater degree of association between you and the Swopblock Project than actually exists.

In any way that implies a designated successor to Swopblock (e.g., "Swopblock++" is not permitted).

In any way that indicates that Swopblock favors one distribution, platform, product, etc. over another except where explicitly indicated in writing by Swopblock LLC.

In any other way that dilutes or otherwise infringes upon the trademark rights of Swopblock LLC and the Swopblock Project in the Marks.

To refer to the Swopblock software, modified by a third party to the point of inoperability with Swopblock software in substantially unmodified form.

In addition, you may not use any of the Marks as a syllable in a new word or as part of a portmanteau (e.g., "Swopblockalicious", "Swopblockpedia") used as a mark for a third-party product or service without Swopblock's written permission. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision applies even to third-party marks that use the Marks as a syllable or as part of a portmanteau to refer to a product or service's use of Swopblock code.

Limitations to this Policy:

This Policy does not confer any rights to use any other trademarks other than the Marks listed in Section 1. This Policy does not authorize you to act as an agent for Swopblock LLC, enter into any agreement on behalf of or otherwise create any liability for the Swopblock Project or Swopblock LLC.

Use of the Marks in merchandising:

You may not create and/or sell merchandise bearing any of the Marks without Conservancy's express written permission. If you are interested in using creating and/or selling merchandise bearing any of the the Marks, please send proofs of your designs to us at info@swopblock.org.

Determine compliance with this Policy.
